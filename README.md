# Strassen's-Matrix-Multiplication
Matrix Multiplication is possibly one of the most important matrix operations and is actively employed in multiple scientific and engineering applications. But the main problem faced during computing the product of matrices is that matrix multiplication is a computationally intensive algorithm. The worst time complexity of the traditional or naive Matrix Multiplication algorithm is O(n^3) due to which this algorithm is not suitable for larger sizes of matrices. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm is a newer and interesting approach to compute the product of matrices and manages to reduce the worst time complexity. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm uses a Divide and Conquer approach to bring down the time complexity to approximately O(n^2.81).
